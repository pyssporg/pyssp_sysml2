# Test Fixtures

`aircraft_subset/` contains a compact subset extracted from the repository's
main `architecture/*.sysml` model. It keeps representative elements for
standalone parser validation:

- `part def` blocks with attributes and in/out ports
- `port def` payload schemas
- `connect` statements
- `comment` requirement entries
